Your SMARTER edge demo applications have been provisioned.  
If you edge-nodes are labeled correctly with the node 
4selectors as defined in values.yaml then the smarter edge demo daemonsets
will be automatically deployed to your edge nodes and forward data to your 
cloud instance to be visualized in grafana.

If you haven't already done so, provision your cloud side infrastructure to 
be able to receive data from your edgem nodes.

Your SMARTER edge infrastructure has been provisioned.  If you edge-nodes are labeled correctly with the node 
selectors as defined in values.yaml (default smarter.type: edge) then the smarter edge infrastructure daemonsets
will be automatically deployed to your edge nodes.

If you haven't already done so, provision your cloud side infrastructure to be able to receive data from your edgem nodes.
